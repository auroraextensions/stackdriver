## Description

Stackdriver aggregates metrics, logs, and events from infrastructure, giving developers and
operators a rich set of observable signals that speed root-cause analysis and reduce mean
time to resolution (MTTR). Stackdriver doesn't require extensive integration or multiple
"panes of glass", and it won't lock developers into using a particular cloud provider.

## Services

- [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/)
- [Stackdriver Error Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/)
